The REST API Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
## Software Requirements

-   Node.js **8+**
-   MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)

## How to install
### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.
## How to run

### Running  API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```
**Note:**  `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.
